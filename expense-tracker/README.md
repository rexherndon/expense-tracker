# Expense Tracker

---

This is a basic expense tracker that allows users to enter, view, and delete their expenses. It includes a form where users can enter the description, amount, and category of their expenses. Below that is a table that shows a list of all of the expenses entered into the application, and user’s can delete their expenses from the table as needed.

This application was created using the following tools:

- Typescript and React JS
- Bootstrap CSS
- React Hook Form and Zod (for form validation)

This application is no longer in development or being maintained, as it was just intended to be a prototype, but it can still be used in it’s current state. Thank you for checking this out, and I hope you enjoy it! - Rex
